# Music-Player-with-Spotify-API
Created a very simple music player in C# combined with Spotifys API to let users search and play music
So for the application to work you will need Spotify Premium, this is something thats required to run their api and also the music provided.
You will also need the Spotify application running in the background, in order for the application to also work.
The music will be played from spotifys client and not mine, which is also something required in order to use their api.
You need to make a few changes in the code.
Make sure to use your client and spotify id and token, in order for token exchanges, once you have that figured out you can go ahead and proceed.
Once the program/app is running, sign in via your Spotify premium account. The first time it will send you to a authorization page where you have to agree to the OAuth authentication. After that you can go ahead and close that window and start searching for some music!
